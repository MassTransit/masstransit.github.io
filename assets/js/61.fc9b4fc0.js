It was at this conference that Chris and Dru not only realized that they had a lot of the same problems to solve, but also how much the standard tooling provided by Microsoft just didn't fit their needs. Surrounded by the best and brightest in .NET, the energy was there to build better tooling that supported testable processes. Combined with an awareness of the latest advances in tooling, libraries, and coding practices; they decided that a better option must exist. After searching the .NET ecosystem for a tool that would help them achieve their goals, the only real option was the venerable NServiceBus. After reviewing NServiceBus, it was determined that the only real dependency injection container supported was Spring.NET. It also became obvious that NServiceBus wasn't quite ready for external contributors to come on board. For these reasons, they decided to embark on the quixotic trek of building their own service bus (seriously, how hard could it be??
